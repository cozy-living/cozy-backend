## Cozy

## This is the backend repo for Cozy.

### App Description

Cozy is a community property management system that contains features including:

* Dash Board – designed to announce upcoming events, alert, monthly newsletter and condo policy
* Discuss Board – designed for resident to post anecdotes, concerns or whatever they want, for example like, I found the
  light in lower garage is out of work
* Chat Thread – designed for trustee to communicate instead of using email thread, the idea is coming from slack
* Calendar Schedule – designed to book common room, reserve maintain service for the condo, such as dumpster clean,
  garage clean, fire alarm testing, or elevator inspection, etc.
* Payment Tool – designed to pay condo fee, common room reserve fee (but here we should concern about the data safety
  and privacy issue)

### Git Instructions

1. Run `git clone git@github.com:cozy-living/cozy.git` to clone the project to your local machine. If you haven't set up
   the SSH key already, check out [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
2. `cd` into the repo you just created, run `git checkout -b [your name]` to create your own branch. Next time you want
   to switch to a different branch, make sure you've committed all your local changes first, then
   run `git checkout [branch name]`.
3. After you have made some code changes on your branch, run `git add .`, `git commit -m "your commit message"`
   , `git push` to commit your change to your remote branch on GitHub. Note that you need to
   run `git push --set-upstream origin [your branch name]` **the first time** after you created your local branch. Only
   push codes to GitHub if you make sure that the app is not broken after your latest code change.
4. Regularly push your code to GitHub, and make pull requests from main branch to fetch latest changes.
